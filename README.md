#### What am I up to?

I am currently working on a project analyzing the intercondectedness of fisheries and aquauclture development in the state of California with considerations for policy, social and ecological dimensions. I am also working on the development of a dynamic urchin and kelp model which will project population dynamics as purple urhcin ranching is established.
